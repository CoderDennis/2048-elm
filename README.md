A clone of [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) (itself a clone of [1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024)) in [elm](http://elm-lang.org/).

The main intention of this project is to serve as a learning exercise for myself, and to provide an example to others who are trying to learn elm. With that in mind, if you see anything that has been done in a less than optimal way, feel free to fork and open a pull request, or just to let me know about it.

## Original write up / tutorial

The original write up for this project is available [here](http://scrambledeggsontoast.github.io/2014/05/09/writing-2048-elm/). Elm has changed a lot since then, so this repository is an attempt by [CoderDennis](http://github.com/CoderDennis) to update it to Elm 0.18.
